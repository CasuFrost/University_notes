As a guideline for this fish pie, I used a couple of recipes from Vickie De Beer's amazing Low Carb Diabetes Cookbook. It's one of my favourite cookbooks and I've tried and adapted many of the recipes, such as my almond cream cheese pancakes, which is to date the most popular recipe on Sugar Free Londoner. If you enjoy leafing through a cookbook for ideas, this is the one to get, whether you're diabetic or not.

As you can see, these the pics are as honest as they come. This fish pie was piping hot when I photographed it, because I WANTED TO EAT IT as soon as possible (and I did). One of the secrets in food photography is that casserole portions remain in beautiful photogenic rectangles when cold, and I admit, when I transferred the leftovers into a smaller dish at the end of the day, they looked rather perfect.

This is exactly what your fish pie will look like when you serve it straight from the oven - a little messy, a little floppy and utterly delicious.

You can eat it with a green side salad, if you wish, or just tuck in. It is really filling, so you might have leftovers for a couple of days to come.
